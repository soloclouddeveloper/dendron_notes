## Section 1: Designing highly scalable, available, and reliable cloud-native applications (~36% of the exam)

---

### **1.1 Designing high-performing applications and APIs. Considerations include:**

- Choosing the appropriate platform based on the use case and requirements (e.g., Compute Engine, GKE, Cloud Run)

- Building, refactoring, and deploying application containers to Cloud Run and GKE
- Understanding how Google Cloud services are geographically distributed (e.g., latency, regional services, zonal services)

- Configuring load balancers and applications for session affinity and performant content delivery
  - [Session Affinity](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/backend-service#session_affinity)
    - > Session affinity lets you control how the load balancer selects backends for new connections in a predictable way as long as the number of healthy backends remains constant.
    - Useful for stateful applications that require the same backend for the same user.
    - Best-effort basis (based on):
      - backend health
      - adding/removing backends
      - weights
    - Best used when large distibution of unique connections    
    - By default, GCP LBs determine BE based on 5 parameters
    - Packet's source IP 
    - Packet's source port (if in packet header)
    - Packet's desitnation IP 
    - Packet's destination port (if in packet header)
    - Packet's protocol
  
    - **Types of affinity**
      - Client IP, no destination affinity
        - single tuple hash
        - available only for internal passthrough Network LBs 
      - Client IP 
        - two tuple hash created from **source** IP and **destination** IP
        - Available to all GCP LB with BEs
      - Generated Cookie 
        - > the load balancer includes an HTTP cookie in the Set-Cookie header in response to the initial HTTP request.
        - name of cookie depends on type of LB
        - > he load balancer directs those requests to the same backend instance or endpoint, as long as the session affinity cookie remains valid
      - [Header field](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/backend-service#header_field_affinity)
        - > With header field affinity, requests are routed to the backends based on the value of the HTTP header in the consistentHash.httpHeaderName field of the backend service. 
        - See documentation for types of LBs available
      - [HTTP Cookie affinity](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/backend-service#http_cookie_affinity)
        - > When you use HTTP cookie-based affinity, the load balancer includes an HTTP cookie in the Set-Cookie header in response to the initial HTTP request. You specify the name, path, and time to live (TTL) for the cookie
        - Available LBs:
          - All application LBs
          - Cloud Service Mesh
      - [Stateful cookie-based affinity](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/backend-service#stateful-session-affinity)
        - > When you use stateful cookie-based affinity, the load balancer includes an HTTP cookie in the Set-Cookie header in response to the initial HTTP request. You specify the name, path, and time to live (TTL) for the cookie.
        - Available LBs:
          - All application LBs, **except** classic Application LB
          - As long as cookie is valid and BE is available the LB will direct to specific BE.
        - **Differences** to other session affinity LBs:
          - > Stateful cookie-based affinity has no specific requirements for the balancing mode or for the load balancing locality policy (localityLbPolicy)
          - > Stateful cookie-based affinity is not affected when autoscaling adds a new instance to a managed instance group
          - > Stateful cookie-based affinity is not affected when autoscaling removes an instance from a managed instance group unless the selected instance is removed
          - > Stateful cookie-based affinity is not affected when autohealing removes an instance from a managed instance group unless the selected instance is removed
        - **Zero TTL Cookie Affinity**
          - LB does not assign an `Expire` attribute
          - Different browsers treat Zero TTL differently                                                                    

- Implementing caching solutions (e.g., Memorystore)
  - [Valkey](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/valkey/product-overview)
  - [Redis Cluster](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/cluster/memorystore-for-redis-cluster-overview)
  - [Redis](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/redis/memorystore-for-redis-overview)
    - secured via private IP address, same authorized VPC, IAM roles
  - [Memcached](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore/docs/memcached/memcached-overview)
    - binary and ASCII protocol compliant
    - authorized VPC defined during setup and cannot be altered after deployment
    - auto discovery of nodes programmatically
  - > Memorystore for Valkey and Redis Cluster scale without downtime to support up to 250 nodes, terabytes of keyspace, and 60x more throughput than Memorystore for Redis with microsecond latencies
  - > Memorystore for Valkey and Redis Cluster have zero-downtime scaling, automatically distributed replicas across availability zones, and automated failover. Memorystore for Redis Cluster also offers a 99.99% SLA
  - > Session management, frequently accessed queries, scripts, and pages are common examples of caching

-  **Creating and deploying APIs (e.g., HTTP REST, gRPC [Google Remote Procedure Call])**
    - [Bridge The Gap Between gRPC And REST HTTP APIs](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/api-management/bridge-the-gap-between-grpc-and-rest-http-apis)
      - efficient serialization
      - low latency
      - strong typed messages
    - [gRPC Overview](https://cloud.google.com/api-gateway/docs/grpc-overview)
      - > In gRPC, a client application can directly call methods on a server application on a different machine as if it was a local object
     

- **Using application rate limiting, authentication, and observability (e.g., Apigee, Cloud API Gateway)**
  - [Choosing Between Apigee API, Cloud API Gateway and Cloud Endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-modernization/choosing-between-apigee-api-gateway-and-cloud-endpoints)
  - [Apigee](https://cloud.google.com/apigee)
    - Enterprise grade 
    - Any environment, use case or scale 
    - High API volumes 
    - APIs exposed to 3rd parties 
    - High reliability
  - [Cloud API Gateway ](https://cloud.google.com/api-gateway/docs)
    - Fully managed service 
    - Ideal for cloud native apps using GCP services 
    - Inexpesive to get started. 
  - [Cloud Endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs)
    - Requires users to manage every detail of API operations.
    - Configure, deploy and manage [ESPv2 Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs/openapi/glossary#extensible_service_proxy_v2)
    - Most common use case is with gRPC services.
    - 3 Options depending on where API is hosted:
      - OpenAPI 
      - gRPC 
      - App Engine standard enviornment

- **Integrating applications using asynchronous or event-driven approaches (e.g., Eventarc, Pub/Sub)**
  - ChatGPT response for [[pro_cloud_dev.asynch_event_driven]] approaches
    - [Eventarc Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/eventarc/docs)
      - Two types:
        - [Eventarc Standard](https://cloud.google.com/eventarc/standard/docs/overview)
          - Format
            - HTTP requests in binary content mode
            - Payload encoding
              - `application/json`
              - `application/protobuf`
        - [Eventarc Advanced](https://cloud.google.com/eventarc/advanced/docs/overview)
          - [Retry Policy](https://cloud.google.com/eventarc/advanced/docs/overview#event-retry-policy)
            - Default 24 hours with exponential backoff
          - Format 
            - HTTP requests in binary content mode
            - Workflow destinations converts event to JSON object
        - [Features Comparison Chart](https://cloud.google.com/eventarc/docs#features-comparison-table)
      - [Event Definition](https://cloud.google.com/eventarc/advanced/docs/overview#events):
        - > An event is a data record that expresses an occurrence and its context, and indicates a change in a resource or environment. An event is a discrete unit of communication, independent of other events. For example, an event might indicate a change to data in a database, a file added to a storage system, or a scheduled job.
      - Observability
        - detailed logs available in Cloud Auditing Logs

- **Optimizing for cost and resource usage**
  - [Well Architected Framework: Cost Optimization Pillar](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/framework/cost-optimization)

- **Understanding data replication to support zonal and regional failover models**
  - References - [Distaster Recovery](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/disaster-recovery)
  - Zonal Resources hosted in a single zone
    - Zonal resources:
      - Compute Engine (virtual machines)
      - Persistent disks
  - Regional Resources hosted in multi-zones in the same region
  - Multi-regional hosted across multiple regions.

- **Using traffic splitting strategies (e.g., gradual rollouts, rollbacks, A/B testing) on a new service on Cloud Run or GKE**

- **Orchestrating application services with Workflows, Eventarc, Cloud Tasks, and Cloud Scheduler**
  - Reference Dendron page: [[pro_cloud_dev.orchestrating_app_services]]

### **1.2 Designing secure applications. Considerations include:**

- **Implementing data retention and organization policies (e.g., Cloud Storage Object Lifecycle Management, Cloud Storage use and lock retention policies)**
  - [Object Lifecycle Management](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/lifecycle)
    - Lifecycle config
      - a rule contains one action and multiple conditions
      - if multiple rules contain same action, action is applied if any of the conditions are met.
      - if multiple rules have conditions met at same time, then the order is:
        - `delete` takes precedence over `SetStorageClass` action
        - The lowest price of "at rest storage" pricing is used.
    - Lifecycle Actions
      - rule can contain only a single action
      - `Delete`
        - default is soft delete which GCP will retain for 7 days
      - `SetStorageClass`
      - `AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload`
    - [Lifecycle Conditions](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/lifecycle#conditions)
      - All conditions are optional but at least one condition is required.
    - > The object's time spent set at the original storage class counts towards any minimum storage duration that applies for the new storage class.

- Using security mechanisms that identify vulnerabilities and protect services and resources (e.g., Identity-Aware Proxy [IAP], Web Security Scanner)
- Responding to and resolving vulnerabilities, including those identified by Artifact Analysis and Security Command Center
- Storing, accessing, and rotating application secrets, credentials, and encryption keys (e.g., Secret Manager, Cloud Key Management Service, Workload Identity Federation)
- Authenticating to Google Cloud services (e.g., Application Default Credentials, JSON Web Token [JWT], OAuth 2.0, Cloud SQL Auth Proxy, AlloyDB Auth Proxy)
- Managing and authenticating end-user accounts (e.g., Identity Platform)
- Securing cloud resources using Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles for service accounts
- Securing service-to-service communications (e.g., Cloud Service Mesh, Kubernetes Network Policies)
- Running services with least privileged access
- Securing application artifacts using Binary Authorization

### **1.3 Storing and accessing data. Considerations include:**
  -  Selecting the appropriate storage system based on the volume of data and performance requirements
      - Cloud Storage
        - Infinite scale, unlimited amount of objects
        - Max Object size = 5 TB
  -  Designing appropriate schemas for structured databases (e.g., AlloyDB, Spanner) and unstructured databases (e.g., Bigtable, Datastore)
  -  Understanding the implications of eventual and strongly consistent replication of AlloyDB, Bigtable, Cloud SQL, Spanner, and Cloud Storage
  -  Creating signed URLs to grant access to Cloud Storage objects
  -  Writing data to BigQuery for analytics and AI/ML workloads

## Section 2: Building and testing applications (~23% of the exam)

### **2.1 Setting up your development environment. Considerations include:**
  -  Emulating Google Cloud services using the Google Cloud CLI for local application development and local unit testing
    - [Ref Google Official Doc](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/emulators)
    - `glcoud beta emulators GROUP`
        - Possible GROUP:
            - bigtable
            - datastore
            - firestore
            - pubsub
            - spanner
    - [Using Emulator](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/emulator#using_the_emulator)
        - App must be built using Cloud Client Libraries
        - **DOES NOT** support `gcloud pubsub` 
            - What about bigtable, datastore, etc??
  -  Using the Google Cloud console, Cloud SDK, Cloud Code, Gemini Cloud Assist, Gemini Code Assist, Cloud Shell, and Cloud Workstations

### **2.2 Building. Considerations include:**

  -  Using Cloud Build and Artifact Registry to build and store containers from source code
  -  Configuring provenance in Cloud Build (e.g., Binary Authorization)

### **2.3 Testing. Considerations include:**
  -  Writing unit tests with the help of Gemini Code Assist
  -  Executing automated integration tests in Cloud Build

---

## Section 3: Deploying applications (~20% of the exam)

### **3.1 Deploying applications to Cloud Run. Considerations include:**
  -  Deploying applications from source code
  -  Invoking Cloud Run services using triggers (e.g., Eventarc, Pub/Sub)
  -  Configuring event receivers (e.g., Eventarc, Pub/Sub)
  -  Exposing and securing APIs in applications (e.g., Apigee)
  -  Deploying a new API version in Cloud Endpoints considering backward compatibility

### **3.2 Deploying containers to GKE. Considerations include:**
  -  Deploying containerized applications
  -  Defining resource requirements for container workloads
  -  Implementing Kubernetes health checks to increase application availability
      - Readiness probe:  Is the application **ready** to receive traffic?  No - don't send traffic
      - Liveliness probe:  Is the pod responding?  No - restart the pod
  -  Configuring the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for cost optimization
      - 1 New instance at a time, no reduction in capacity:
        - maxSurge: 1 | maxUnavailable: 0
      - Minimum costs, 1 at a time (no increase in number of instances)
        - maxSurge: 0 | maxUnavailable: 1

  - Misc Notes:
    - Default deployment strategy: Rolling update
    - Rolling updates: 
      - Update pods in batches
    - Recreate:
      - Kill all existing pods before new ones are created
    - Network Policy
      - Kubernetes network policies do not configure authentication or authorization, only which pods can communicate with other pods within same namespace.
