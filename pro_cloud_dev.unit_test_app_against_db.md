Asked ChatGPT the following question:

When building an application that obtains data from an existing database, what is the best practice to write unit tests against the database to ensure the application is functioning correctly

---

Great question — this comes up a lot when testing apps that rely on databases. Here's a clear breakdown of **best practices for writing unit tests involving a database**, especially in the context of a **cloud-native or GCP app**:

---

### ✅ **Best Practices for Unit Testing with a Database**

#### 🔹 1. **Avoid Hitting the Real Database**
Unit tests should be **fast, isolated, and deterministic**. Hitting a real database introduces:
- Latency
- Flaky tests
- Environment dependency

Instead, **mock or stub** the database interactions.

---

#### 🔹 2. **Use Dependency Injection**
Inject the database access layer (e.g., repository or DAO) into your service, so you can replace it with a **mock or fake** during unit tests.

Example in pseudocode:
```python
class UserService:
    def __init__(self, user_repo):
        self.user_repo = user_repo

    def get_user_email(self, user_id):
        user = self.user_repo.find_user_by_id(user_id)
        return user.email
```
In the test:
```python
mock_repo = Mock()
mock_repo.find_user_by_id.return_value = User(id=1, email='test@example.com')

service = UserService(mock_repo)
assert service.get_user_email(1) == 'test@example.com'
```

---

#### 🔹 3. **Use Fakes or In-Memory Databases for Lightweight Integration Tests**
If you *must* validate logic against actual database behavior (e.g., SQL queries), use:
- **SQLite in-memory mode** (for SQL-based apps)
- **H2** (for Java)
- **Testcontainers** (runs actual DB in Docker for near-real testing)

But note: **these are *integration* tests**, not true unit tests.

---

#### 🔹 4. **Split Unit and Integration Tests**
- **Unit tests:** Fast, mock DB, run on every commit.
- **Integration tests:** Spin up test DB (e.g., via Docker), test actual data interactions, run separately (e.g., nightly or pre-deploy).

---

#### 🔹 5. **Use Test Data Builders / Fixtures**
Avoid hardcoding data. Instead, use builders or fixtures to create consistent, reusable test objects:
```python
def build_test_user():
    return User(id=1, email='fake@example.com')
```

---

#### 🔹 6. **Don't Test the Database Itself**
Your goal is to test your **application’s behavior**, not whether the DB works. For example:
- ✅ Test that the app queries correctly based on input.
- ❌ Don’t test whether the DB returns rows; that’s not your app logic.

---

### 🛠️ In GCP / Cloud Build Context
- Run **unit tests** in an early pipeline step (no DB).
- Run **integration tests** using a temporary Cloud SQL instance or emulator (Cloud Spanner has an emulator too).
- Use **Cloud Build steps** or **Docker Compose** for setting up a disposable test environment.
